# Privacy Policy

We dont store your data, period.

Look at the code, it doesn't even have the facilities for it.  This is an internal app, what data would we even be storing?  The only reason I need OAuth is to upload videos to my own YouTube channel.

There are no third parties that process any data in this app, we dont even use any third party services.

You can't agree to this privacy policy, becuase I am the only one that will be using this app.
